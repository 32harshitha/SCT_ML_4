# SCT_ML_4
✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Hand Gesture Recognition System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify different hand gestures from image data.
The system enables intuitive human–computer interaction by recognizing hand gestures from images and can be extended to real-time gesture-based control systems.

🎯 Objectives

To recognize and classify hand gestures from image data

To build a CNN-based deep learning model

To support gesture-based human–computer interaction

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow & Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

OpenCV

📂 Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into class-wise folders:

test/
├── 0/
├── 1/
├── 2/
├── ...
└── 19/


Each folder represents one hand gesture

Images are in .jpg format

Total classes: 20

Total images: 6000
